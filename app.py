# --- Title and Introduction ---
st.title("The Relationship and the Impact Between Economic Growth and Meat Consumption")

st.markdown("""
### Main Idea
This project explores the relationship between economic growth (measured by GDP per capita) and meat consumption in various countries, focusing on:
- **Developed Countries:** United States & Germany  
- **Developing Countries:** India & Nigeria  

By analyzing these trends, we aim to uncover how economic prosperity influences dietary habits and how cultural, environmental, and economic factors shape meat consumption patterns globally.

---
            
### Why These Countries?
We selected these countries because they represent different economic stagtes and dietary habits:
- **United States & Germany:** High-income countries with strong food industries and high meat consumption. The U.S. leads in beef and poultry, while Germany consumes more pork.
- **India & Nigeria:** Lower-income countries where cultural and economic factors limit meat consumption. India has a large vegetarian population, while Nigeria's meat intake depends on affordability and availability.

---                         

### Why This Matters
As economies grow, diets change. Meat consumption is more than just a food choiceâ€”it reflects income levels, cultural traditions, and environmental impacts.

**Economic Impact:**
- Higher GDP means people can afford more meat, often viewed as a sign of wealth and improved nutrition.            

**Cultural Influence:**
- Culture shapes food choices, sometimes limiting meat consumption regardless of income.
- **Example:** In India, many avoid beef due to religious beliefs, even though economic growth allows them to afford it. In contrast, pork is deeply rooted in German cuisine, where it remains a staple in traditional dishes.

**Environmental Concerns:**
- Meat productions requires large amounts of land, water and energy. Some meats, like beef, have a high environmental cost.
- **Example:** In the United States, large-scale beef production contributes to high greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, Nigeria's lower meat consumption has a smaller environmental footprint, but as the economy grows, demand for meat may increase, potentially leading to environmental challenges.

Why We Use These Charts:

- **Line Charts:** Best for showing trends over time, making it easy to see how meat consumption has increased or decreased.

- **Bar Charts:** Useful for comparing meat consumption between countries in a single year.

- **Scatter Plots:** Help visualize the relationship between GDP per capita and meat consumption.

- **Heatmaps:** Show correlations between GDP and different types of meat consumption, helping to highlight patterns across multiple variables.

Each chart type was chosen to make complex data easier to understand and to highlight different aspects of the relationship between economic growth and meat consumption.

**Analysis:** This scatter plot shows a clear relationship between GDP per capita and total meat consumption. In general, countries with higher GDP per capita, like the United States and Germany, also have higher levels of meat consumption. This suggests that as people have more money, they are more likely to include meat in their diets. However, in countries like India and Nigeria, the relationship isn't as straightforward. Cultural and religious factors, such as dietary restrictions in India, play a big role in shaping meat consumption regardless of economic status.

# --- Reflection ---
st.markdown("""
### Reflection on the Process

When I first started this project, I thought the relationship between economic growth and meat consumption would be simpleâ€”more money equals more meat. But the deeper I went, the more I realized itâ€™s not that straightforward. I struggled a bit with cleaning and merging the datasets, especially getting the years to match up and making sure the country names were consistent. There were also times when the graphs didnâ€™t look the way I expected, and I had to adjust how I was handling the data.

One thing that surprised me was how much cultural and religious factors affect meat consumption. For instance, Indiaâ€™s low beef consumption has little to do with income levels and more to do with religious beliefs. This made me rethink how I was interpreting the data.

If I had more time, I would probably explore other factors like environmental policies or health trends that might also affect meat consumption. Iâ€™d also look into more specific data on different types of meat in more countries.

What I liked best about this project was seeing how data visualization makes complex information easier to understand. Turning raw data into charts and graphs really helped me (and hopefully others) see patterns that arenâ€™t obvious in a spreadsheet.

# --- Conclusion ---
st.markdown("""
### Conclusion
This project shows that economic growth plays a big role in influencing meat consumption patterns. Developed countries like the United States and Germany tend to have higher meat consumption due to greater economic prosperity and accessibility.

For example, in India, religious beliefs have a strong influence on meat consumption, leading to lower levels of beef and pork consumption. In contrast, Nigeria shows varying patterns influenced by local traditions and economic conditions.

Overall, while economic growth often leads to higher meat consumption, it's clear that other factors like culture, religion, and regional preferences also shape dietary habits. This highlights the complex relationship between economy and food consumption across different countries.
